the field deep learning can be divided into three subfields, deep supervised learning, deep unsupervised learning and deep reinforcement learning . the objective is to approximate compute the output E(x M +1 ) of the (M + 1)-th input data x M+1 without using explicit knowledge of the function E : R d  R . this chapter reviews and studies deterministic GD-type optimization methods . there are several other outstanding reviews on gradient based optimization methods in the literature . cf. Sections 6.5, 6.6, 6.7, and 6.8 below; see Section 6.1 below . in this chapter we review basic ReLU ANN approximation results for a class of one-dimensional target functions . in the scientific literature the capacity of ANNs to approximate certain classes of target functions has been thoroughly studied . cf., for instance, a study of the ability of a ANN to approximate two-dimensional targets .
