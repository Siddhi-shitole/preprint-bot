Direct detection of binary black holes with gravitational waves has provided new opportunities to test general relativity. The gravitational wave emitted throughout the inspiral and merger of a binary black hole system can be decomposed into a superposition of spin-weighted spherical harmonics. If the parameters do not agree across harmonics, then this suggests the presence of hair in the system, a potential violation of GR. Constraints on the deviations of the (ℓ, m) = (3, 3) mode for each event are shown in Fig. All other parameters, including all deviations on the (2, 1) mode (not shown) yield negligible constraints. This is consistent with expectations from GR The individual component spins are not well measured for either event. We performed binary black hole spectroscopy on GW190814 and GW190412 to look for physics beyond general relativity. We obtained non-trivial constraints on the chirp mass and symmetric mass ratio. Consistent with GR, we find that the chorp mass as measured by the (ℓ, m) = (3, 3) mode and the dominant mode agree with each other to percent-level accuracy.
