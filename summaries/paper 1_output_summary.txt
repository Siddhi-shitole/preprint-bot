The direct detection of gravitational waves (GWs) throughout the past decade has been one of the most significant advancements in observational relativity. The sky location and t c have been fixed in earlier studies due to technical hurdles in calculating the likelihood function. In order to independently analyze the pre and postmerger portion of the signal it is necessary to excise the post and premerger data, respectively. We performed eight analyses in total. Each analysis was differentiated by the waveform used, postmerger approximant, and whether or not sky location and t c were marginalized over. Half of the analyses used the original data of GW150914 with a sample rate of 2048 Hz obtained from the Gravitational Wave Open Science Center. All template models utilized IMRPhenomXPHM (abbreviated here on as IMR) to model the premerger signal. This paper presented a novel method of marginalizing over sky location and coalescence time when performing a pre or postmerger analysis. Tests of the area theorem were conducted using data from GW150914 using this method. It was found that the data for this event agrees very well with the area. theorem regardless of whether sky position and t c were allowed to vary.
