The remnant black hole (BH) formed after the coalescence of two compact objects emits gravitational radiation while settling down to a Kerr BH. At late enough times, the ringdown consists of a superposition of exponentially damped sinusoids called quasinormal modes (QNM) The excitation of different QNMs depends on the nature of the perturbation, i.e on the properties of the binary progenitor. In this paper we have applied for the first time the full Bayesian inference framework to a population of BH ringdowns derived from the observational population models. We have allowed for completely variable ringdown phases, inclination angles, polarization angles and sky locations. Within the Bayesian model selection framework, future generations of LIGO detectors will likely deliver measur- A d v  L I G O A + V o y a g e r 10 3 10 2 10 1 10 0 Rate (events / year) V o Y A G E R q = 6.7 FIG able subdominant QNM modes from BBH mergers over the next decade.
