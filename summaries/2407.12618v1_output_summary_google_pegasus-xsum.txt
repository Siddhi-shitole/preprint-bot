In this review, we explore the frontiers of quantum machine learning in finance, exploring its potential in areas such as credit scoring, risk management, stock price prediction, and fraud detection, as it aligns with the applications in finance, such as credit scoring, risk management, stock price prediction, and fraud detection. Quantum Machine Learning (QML) has the potential to transform many areas of finance, including credit scoring, risk management, stock price predictions, and fraud detection, both in the near and long term, according to a review paper published in the Journal of the Royal Society of Chemistry (JRS).
