credit scoring models are decision models that help lenders decide whether to accept a loan application . a number of challenges posed when working with XAI include: "who are the explanations for (experts or users)?" and "how can we evaluate the results?" . eXplainable AI: appending interpretable explanations to the classification predictions . a credit scoring model is proposed for this work . the model is based on a model of a standardized credit scoring system . this work is expected to be completed by the end of january . the aim of this study is to enhance the credit scoring system with interpretability . the analysis of the explanations is important since it moves us away from vague claims about interpretability and towards evaluating methods by a common set of terms . this project addresses this gap by adopting a comprehensive evaluation approach, where apart from the usual human subjective analysis, the interpretability efficiency is also analysed . credit scoring helps financial experts make better decisions regarding whether or not to accept a loan application . recent regulations such as the  right to explanation ' have added the need for model interpretability to ensure that algorithmic decisions are understandable and coherent . in this work, we present a credit scoring model with state-of-the-art classification performance on the HELOC and Lending Club Datasets .
