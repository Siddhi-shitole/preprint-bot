Deep learning is a branch of computer science which deals with the problem of learning from large amounts of data, such as images, video, audio, and other data which can be difficult to train on its own., In this article we will look at some ideas of deep supervised learning and how they can be applied to a variety of problems. gradient-based (GD)-type optimization methods have been widely used in computer science and engineering for many years, but their applications have been limited to the design and analysis of complex systems such as Riemann surfaces, finite element models, or even for the design and analysis of space-time networks. AnNearest neighbour (ANN) approximation is a branch of artificial intelligence that deals with the problem of finding approximated functions for a given class of target functions in a Hilbert space., in this chapter we review basic ReLU ANN approximation results for a class of one-dimensional target functions (see Section 3.3) ANN approximation results for multi-dimensional target functions are treated in Chapter 4 below
