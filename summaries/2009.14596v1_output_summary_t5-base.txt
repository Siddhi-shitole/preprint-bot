in this article, we review what has been learned on a variety of tasks in traditional AI . this includes classifying images, generating new images such as (fake) human faces . besides being extremely powerful, neural network-based machine learning has got the reputation of being a set of tricks . the key idea here is coarse graining, and iterating between the fine scale and the coarse-grained problem . the effective coarse grain problem is simply the free energy associated with this set of coarsegrained variables . this step is trivial for linear problems, and this is where machine learning can help .
