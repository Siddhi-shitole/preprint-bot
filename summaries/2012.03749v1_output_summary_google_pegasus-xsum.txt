XAI is an artificial intelligence (AI) company that designs, develops and tests credit scoring models for a variety of industries, including finance, energy, manufacturing, and healthcare, as well as for government agencies and academic research institutions, such as the UK's National Crime Agency (NCA) and the UK's Financial Conduct Authority (FCA). This work aims to develop an interpretable artificial intelligence (AI) model for predicting the likelihood of a borrower defaulting on a credit card, based on a set of data about the borrower's financial situation, such as age, income, debt, and repayment history.., in particular, the likelihood that the borrower will default on the credit card. In this study, we have adopted a comprehensive evaluation approach, where apart from the usual human subjective analysis, the interpretability efficiency is also analysed through functionally-grounded techniques so as to provide results in non-subjective and scientific metrics Table 1 The Credit Scoring System with interpretability is an important area of research in the field of artificial intelligence. Credit scoring has gained substantial academic interest in Financial Technology ( FinTech) and the recent enthusiasm boosted in FinTech FinTech regulations such as the ECOA and the Equal Credit Opportunity Act ( ECOA) have added the need for a model interpretability to ensure that loans with a high probability of default are not accepted.
