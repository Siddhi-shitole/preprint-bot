a desirable body of theorems better summarizes the set of all provable statements by having a small description length while at the same time being close ( in terms of number of derivation steps) . this paper builds on the idea that current deep learning mostly succeeds at system 1 abilities -which correspond to our intuition and habitual behaviors -but still lacks something important regarding system 2 abilities . making progress on designing an AI mathematician could help progress in other areas of AI research .
