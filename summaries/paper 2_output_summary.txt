The ringdown signal of a binary black hole merger is related to the resonating space-time of the resulting final black hole. In black hole spectroscopy, the detection of multiple ringdown modes enables us to assess the compatibility of a merger event with predictions from General Relativity. The study was published in the online edition of the British Journal of Clinical Nutrition. In this paper, we investigate the nature of the GW190521 event by analyzing two sets of injections labeled as A and B. We observe that the (3, 3, 0) mode exhibits a more prominent peak compared to other combinations of modes studied in this paper. In future work, we plan to study the recovery of intrinsic binary parameters from simulated signals through black hole spectroscopy.
